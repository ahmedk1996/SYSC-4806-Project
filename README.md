Project Descripition:
This project is intended to serve as a fourth year project managment system and its users include professors, co-ordinators and students. Each has thier own unique functionality towards the system. Coordinators can search for students without a project and send them a reminder as well as allocate oral presentations to rooms determined on the availbility of the prof and student which they specify.

Milestone 1:
We initially started with the idea of creating an Amazin online bookstore, during our first scrum meeting, however after reviewing the projects again thouroghly we decided to change over to create a 4th Year Project Managment System due to its relevance to our current universty standing. 

We were able to deploy the project onto Heroku and it can be accessed through the following website: management-systems.herokuapp.com.

Our current project has a landing page from which the user can select whether they are a student, professor or co-ordinator. Regarding the login page for each user type we haven't implemented the functionlity onto the current milestone, therefore once a user selects the their type, they are directed instantly to the functionality of each user. 

Currently the user features that are currently implemented are student and professor where the student can view all the topics created by the professor, however the ability to enter the topics are not yet available. Whilst the professor has the ability to add multiple topics and view them.

Milestone 2:
We have added the functionality for a student to submit their 4th year report, created a landing page for students, created a landing page for the professor, made tests regarding the core classes, fixed the previous UML and ORM diagrams which are now updated in the root of the GitHub directory and set up the co-ordinator page.

Known Issues Milestone 2:
The login page has not yet been implemented and therefore it's difficult to test some features, however it should be up and running by the third milestone. 


Future Tasks for upcoming Milestone 3:
We will implement the login pages for each type of user as well as add on to the functionality already existing and set up the co-ordinator to have the ability to search for students without a project and send them a reminder as well as allocate oral presentations to rooms determined on the availbility of the prof and student.
