FROM THE PROJECT OUTLINE
{
Milestone 1: Early prototype. Give a 10-15 minute demo during the lab on March 6
th
.
For this milestone we are looking to see enough functionality to get a feel for the system and how it will
work. One important use case should be operational. It should collect data from the back end, do
something with it and display the result. The display doesn't need to be fancy. There should be a GitHub
repo, integrated with Travis CI (or other hosted CI), and the app should be up and running on Heroku.
We will also inspect the README file, the Issues, the Kanban, the code reviews, the tests, and we will
verify that everybody is participating in all aspects of the project (if that is not the case, different team
members will end up with different grades)
